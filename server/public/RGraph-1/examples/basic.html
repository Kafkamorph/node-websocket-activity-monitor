        onload event enabling you to put this in your page header.

        bar.Set('chart.colors', ['red']);
        bar.Set('chart.title', 'A basic graph (big, but basic)');
        bar.Set('chart.labels', ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']);

    <p>
        This is a very basic example that does little more than display a graph. If you're trying to understand how RGraph
        works, this should help as there is very little happening on this page. To see the source code of this
        page simply view the source (Right click > View Source).
